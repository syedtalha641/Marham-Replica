# Marham-Replica
The purpose of this application is aimed to address the challenges often associated with booking
appointments with healthcare providers. Traditional appointment booking systems can be
time-consuming and inconvenient, leading to delays in receiving medical care. Additionally, the process
of managing appointments, coordinating with doctors, and handling payments along with the platform
fees can be complex and fragmented.

# Project Scope
The web application will encompass the following key features:
1. User registration and authentication.
2. Doctor appointment booking.
3. Diagnostic laboratory test booking.
4. Secure online payment for appointments and services.
5. User profiles with medical history and test results storage.
6. Automated reminders and notification.

# Technology Stack
The technology stack for the web application project includes:
1. TypeScript, NodeJS, and GraphQL for server-side development.
2. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React libraries for front-end development.
3. PostgresDB as the relational database.
4. Online APIs for secure online payments.
